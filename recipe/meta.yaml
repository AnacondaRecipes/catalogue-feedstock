  summary: 'Super lightweight function registries for your library'
  description: |
      catalogue is a tiny, zero-dependencies library that makes it easy to add
      function (or object) registries to your code. Function registries are helpful
      when you have objects that need to be both easily serializable and fully
      customizable. Instead of passing a function into your object, you pass in
      an identifier name, which the object can use to lookup the function from
      the registry. This makes the object easy to serialize, because the name
      is a simple string. If you instead saved the function, you'd have to use
      Pickle for serialization, which has many drawbacks.
